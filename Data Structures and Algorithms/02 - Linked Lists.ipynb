    "### What is a singly linked list?\n",
    "- A **singly linked list** is a collection of **nodes** that collectively form a linear sequence. \n",
    "- Each **node** stores a **reference to an object** that is an element of the sequence and a **reference to the next node** of the list. \n",
    "- The **head** is the first node of the linked list, and it has nothing pointing to it.\n",
    "- The **tail** is the last node of the linked list, and it points to None or nothing. \n",
    "- Going through the nodes is known as **traversing** a linked list (also known as hopping)\n",
    "### Inserting elements into a singly linked list\n",
    "- Linked lists do not have a predetermined, fixed size. The space it uses is proportional to its current number of elements.\n",
    "- To insert a new element at the **head** of a linked list:\n",
    "    1. Create a new node\n",
    "    2. Set its element to the new element\n",
    "    3. Set the next link to refer to the current head\n",
    "    4. Set the list's head to point to a new node\n",
    "- To insert a new element at the **tail** of a linked list:\n",
    "    1. Create a new node\n",
    "    2. Assign its next reference to None\n",
    "    3. Set the next reference of the previous tail to point to the new node \n",
    "    4. Update the tail reference to be the new tail\n",
    "### Removing an element from a singly linked list\n",
    "- To remove an element from the **head** of a linked list:\n",
    "    1. Point the head to the next element\n",
    "    2. Remove old head\n",
    "- To remove an element from the **tail** of a linked list:\n",
    "    - Not easily done; Requires making a doubly linked list"
